    <abstract>
      <t>The generation of BGP adj-rib-in, local-rib or adj-rib-out comes from
      BGP route exchange and route policy processing. BGP Monitoring Protocol
      (BMP) provides the monitoring of <xref target="RFC7854">BGP
      adj-rib-in</xref>, <xref target="I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-local-rib">BGP
      local-rib</xref> and <xref target="RFC8671">BGP adj-rib-out</xref>. By
      monitoring these BGP RIBs the full state of the network is visible, but
      how route policies affect the route propagation or changes BGP attributes
      is still not. This document describes a method of using BMP to record
      the trace data on how BGP routes are (not) changed under the process of
      route policies.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The typical processing procedure after receiving a BGP Update Message
      at a routing device is as follows: 1. Adding the pre-policy routes into
      the pre-policy adj-rib-in (if any); 2. Filtering the pre-policy routes
      through inbound route policies; 3. Selecting the BGP best routes from
      the post-policy routes; 4. Adding the selected routes into the BGP
      local-rib; 5-a. Adding the BGP best routes from local-rib to the core
      routing table manager for selection; 5-b. Filtering the routes from BGP
      local-rib through outbound route policies w.r.t. per peer or peer
      groups; 6. Sending the BGP adj-rib-out to the target peer or peer
      groups. Details may vary by vendors. The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)
      can be utilized to monitor BGP routes in forms of adj-rib-in, local-rib
      and adj-rib-out. However, the complete procedure from inbound to
      outbound policy processing, including other policies, e.g., route
      redistribution, route selection and so on, is currently unobserved. For
      example, there are 10 policy items (or nodes) configured under one
      outbound route policy per a specific peer. By collecting the local-rib
      and adj-rib-out through BMP, the operator finds that the outbound policy
      did not work as expected. However, it is hard to distinguish which one of
      the 10 policy items/nodes is responsible for the failure.</t>

      <section title="BGP Route Policy and Attribute Trace Overview">
        <t>This document describes a method that records and reports how each
        policy item/node processes the routes (e.g., changes the route
        attribute). Each policy item/node processing is called an event
        thereafter in this document. Compared with conventional BGP RIB entry,
        which consists of prefix/mask, route attributes, e.g., next hop, MED,
        local preference, AS path, and so on, the event record discussed in
        this document includes different information, such as event index,
        timestamp, policy information, and so on. For example, if a route is
        processed by 5 policy items/nodes, there can be 5 event records for
        the same prefix/mask. Each event is numbered in order of time (e.g.,
        the time of policy execution). The policy information includes the
        policy name and item/node ID/name so that the server/controller can
        map to the exact policy either directly from the device or from the
        configurations collected at the server side.</t>

        <t>This document defines a new BMP message type to carry the recorded
        policy and route data. More detailed message format is defined in
        Section 2. The message is called the BMP Route Policy and Attribute
        Trace Message thereafter in this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Use cases">
        <t>There are cases where a new policy is configured incorrectly, e.g.,
        setting an incorrect community value, or a policy being placed in an
	incorrect order among other policies. These may result in incorrect
	route attribute modification, best route selection mistake, or route
        distribution mistake. With the correlated record of policy and route,
        the server/controller is able to identify the unexpected route change
        and its responsible policy. Considering the fact that the BGP route
        policy impacts not only route processing within the individual device
        but also route distribution to its peers, the route trace data of a
        single device is always analyzed in correlation with such data
        collected from its peer devices.</t>

        <t>Apart from the policy validation application, route trace data
        can also be used to discover the route propagation path within the
        network. With records of route inbound and outbound events collected
        from each related device, the server is able to find the propagation
        path hop by hop. The identified path is helpful for operators to
        better understand its network, and thus benefiting both network
        troubleshooting and network planning.</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>Type = TBD2 (2 Bytes): Policy TLV.</t>

              <t>Length (2 Bytes): indicates the length of the Policy Value
              field that follows it. The Policy value field includes the
              reserved Flag Byte, Policy Count field, Policy Classification
              field, Peer Router ID field, Peer AS field, and each Policy
              field.</t>

              <t>Flag Byte (1 Byte): the M bit (the left most bit) indicates
              whether the route in this event is matched (once or multiple times)
              or not by any policies. "0" means no match and "1" means otherwise.
              When the M bit is set to "0", the Post-Policy Attribute
              TLV SHALL not be included in the Message. The P bit (the second
              left bit) indicates whether the matched result is Permit or Deny.
	      "0" means Deny and "1" means Permit. When the M bit is set to "0",
              any value of the P bit SHOULD be ignored. When the P bit is set
              to "0", the Post-Policy Attribute TLV SHALL not be included in
              the Message. The D bit (the third left bit) indicates whether there
              exists any difference between the pre-policy attributes and the
              post policy attributes. "0" means no difference and "1" means
              difference exists. When the D bit is set to "0", the Post-Policy
              Attribute TLV SHALL not be included in the Message.</t>

              <t>Policy Count (1 Byte): indicates the number of policies (in
              the format of Policy name + Item ID) carried in this event.</t>

              <t>Policy Classification (1 Byte): indicates the category of the
              policy. Currently 8 policy categories are defined: "00000000"
              indicates the Inbound policy; "00000001" indicates the Outbound
              policy; "00000010" indicating the Multi-protocol Redistribute
              policy (including routes import from other protocols, like
              ISIS/OSPF and static routes), "00000011" indicates the Cross-VRF
              Redistribute policy (route import between VRF and global table
              and between VRFs); "00000100" indicates VRF Import policy (e.g.,
              an IPv4 route within a VRF transformed from a VPNv4 route),
              "00000101" indicates VRF Export policy (e.g., a VPNv4 route
              transformed from an IPv4 route within an VRF); "00000110"
              indicates the Network policy (BGP network installment and
              advertisement), "00000111" indicates the Aggregation policy;
              "00001000" indicating the Route Withdraw (triggered by BGP
              Update or local actions, e.g., route aggregation).
              Specifications regarding each category can be included in the
              String TLV. For the route update, i.e. route creation and
              withdrawal, that is not processed by any route policy, the
              Policy Category field is set per the route update point. In
              addition, the Policy ID field in the Policy ID TLV SHOULD be set
              to 0.</t>

              <t>Peer Address (16 Bytes): The remote IP address associated
	      with the TCP session over which the encapsulated PDU was received.
	      It is 4 bytes long if an IPv4 address is carried in this field
	      (with the 12 most significant bytes zero-filled) and 16 bytes
	      long if an IPv6 address is carried in this field.</t>

              <t>Peer Router ID (4 Bytes): indicates the BGP Router ID where
              this policy is configured under. This field is used in
              combination with the Policy Classification field. If the Policy
              Classification field is set to "00000000", meaning Inbound
              policy, then this field is set to the BGP router ID where the
              route is received from; if the Policy Classification field is
              set to "00000001", meaning Outbound policy, then this field is
              set to the BGP router ID where the route is distributed to. If
              the Policy Direction field is set to any other values, then this
              field is set to all zeros.</t>

              <t>Peer AS (4 Bytes): indicates the AS number of the BGP Peer
              that defined the Peer ID field.</t>

              <t>1st ~ Last Policy (Variable): indicates the Policy name and
              the Item ID of each policy match.</t>

              <t>Flag Byte (1 Byte): the C bit (left most bit) indicates whether 
              the next subsequent policy has chaining relationship to the
              current policy. "1" means there is chaining relationship and "0"
              means otherwise. For the flag byte following the Last Policy
              field, the C bit SHALL be set to "0". The R bit (second left
              bit) indicates whether the next subsequent policy has recursion to
              the current policy. "1" means it has recursion and "0" means
              otherwise. For the flag byte following the Last Policy field,
	      the R bit SHALL be set to "0".</t>
